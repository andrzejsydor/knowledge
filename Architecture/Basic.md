# SOLID #SOLID

**The mnemonic acronym SOLID incorporates a set of software principles of object-oriented design.** Originally introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper _“Design Principles and Design Patterns”_, and later turned into an acronym by Michael Feathers, the ingredients of SOLID are:

- S﻿ingle responsibility principle
- O﻿pen-closed principle
- L﻿iskov substitution principle
- I﻿nterface segregation principle
- D﻿ependency inversion principle

# CUPID #CUPID

**CUPID is the creation of Dan North, originating as a criticism of the SOLID principles above.**
**CUPID principles have the same basic philosophy as SOLID: when coding, think about the people who will come after you.**

- Composable
- Unix
- Predictable
- Idiomatic
- Domain-based
