## API Gateway

### Core responsibilities typically include:

- Routing requests to the right backend service
- Rate limiting and brute force protection
- Caching to reduce backend load
- TLS termination and protocol translation
- Logging and observability for monitoring traffic
- Request/response transformation for adapting formats
