# Note Taking Tips

- **Handwritten Notes**: Utilize a reliable pen to enhance memory retention and comprehension through the physical act of writing.
- **Visual Notes**: Incorporate colors and sketch notes to differentiate information and facilitate visual learning.
- **Structured Organization**: Employ formats such as outlines or mind maps to systematically arrange information for easy reference.
- **Active Listening**: Engage actively with the material by summarizing key points and asking questions during note-taking.
- **Consistent Review**: Regularly revisit and revise notes to reinforce understanding and aid long-term retention.
- **Use of Digital Tools**: Leverage note-taking applications that allow for easy editing, searching, and sharing of notes when appropriate.
- **Highlighting and Annotation**: Emphasize important concepts and add personal annotations to deepen comprehension and recall.
- **Minimal Distractions**: Create a focused environment by minimizing interruptions and organizing note-taking materials effectively.
- **Summarize in Your Own Words**: Paraphrasing information forces your brain to process and understand the material deeper than verbatim copying.
- **Spaced Repetition**: Review your notes at increasing intervals (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month) to combat the forgetting curve.
- **Strategic Tagging**: Use a consistent tagging system to link related concepts across different notes, facilitating future retrieval.
- **Capture Questions**: Write down questions that arise during note-taking to guide future study and clarify misunderstandings.
- **Audio Backup**: Record lectures or meetings (with permission) to fill in gaps in your written notes later.
- **Retrieval Practice**: After taking notes, close them and write what you remember—then check for gaps. This builds durable memory better than rereading.
- **Actionable Next Steps**: End notes with 1–3 concrete actions (e.g., “solve 5 problems,” “draft summary,” “look up term X”) to turn notes into progress.

## Processing Workflow (quick)

1. **Capture** (during): messy, fast, minimal formatting.
2. **Clarify** (same day): fix headings, define terms, mark uncertainties.
3. **Connect**: add links to related notes + 2–5 keywords/tags.
4. **Compress**: write a 2–4 sentence summary + key bullets.
5. **Practice**: create 3–5 questions/flashcards from the note.

## Methodologies

- **The Cornell Method**: A systematic format for condensing and organizing notes. It divides the page into three sections: cues, notes, and summary. This method encourages active recall and synthesis of information.

- **Zettelkasten**: A knowledge management method for generating connections between ideas. It involves creating "atomic" notes that are linked together, forming a web of knowledge rather than a linear hierarchy.

- **PARA Method**: A system for organizing digital life based on four categories: Projects (current goals), Areas (ongoing responsibilities), Resources (topics of interest), and Archives (inactive items). It promotes actionability.

- **Mind Mapping**: A visual way to organize information. It starts with a central concept and branches out into related ideas, making it excellent for brainstorming and seeing relationships between topics.

- **Feynman Technique**: Explain the concept in simple language as if teaching a beginner; identify gaps, revisit sources, and refine your explanation.

- **Progressive Summarization**: Revisit notes in layers (bold key lines → highlight core ideas → write a short summary) so the note gets more useful over time without rewriting everything.
