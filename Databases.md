# Databases

## Relational
Traditional row-and-column databases, great for structured data and transactions.

## Columnar
Optimized for analytics, storing data by columns for fast aggregations.

## Key-Value
Stores data as simple key–value pairs, enabling fast lookups.

## In-memory
Stores data in RAM for ultra-low latency lookups, ideal for caching or session management.

## Wide-Column
Handles massive amounts of semi-structured data across distributed nodes.

## Time-series
Specialized for metrics, logs, and sensor data with time as a primary dimension.

## Immutable Ledger
Ensures tamper-proof, cryptographically verifiable transaction logs.

## Graph
Models complex relationships, perfect for social networks and fraud detection.

## Document
Flexible JSON-like storage, great for modern apps with evolving schemas.

## Geospatial
Manages location-aware data such as maps, routes, and spatial queries.

## Text-search
Full-text indexing and search with ranking, filters, and analytics.

## Blob
Stores unstructured objects like images, videos, and files.

## Vector
Powers AI/ML apps by enabling similarity search across embeddings.

## NewSQL
Combines the scalability of NoSQL with the ACID guarantees of relational databases.

## Multi-model
Supports multiple data models (e.g., document, graph, relational) within a single backend.
