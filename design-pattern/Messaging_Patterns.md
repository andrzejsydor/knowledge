# Eventsourcing Patterns

**Forgettable Payloads**
[forgettable-payloads](https://verraes.net/2019/05/eventsourcing-patterns-forgettable-payloads/)

> Store the sensitive payload of an event in a separate store to control access and removal.

**Crypto-Shredding**
[throw-away-the-key](https://verraes.net/2019/05/eventsourcing-patterns-throw-away-the-key/)

> Encrypt sensitive information in an event and delete the key.

**Decision Tracking**
[patterns-decision-tracking](https://verraes.net/2019/05/eventsourcing-patterns-decision-tracking/)

> Store the outcome of a decision to guard against rule changes.

**Migration Events in a Ghost Context**
[migration-events-ghost-context](https://verraes.net/2019/06/eventsourcing-patterns-migration-events-ghost-context/)

> Explicitly conform to the legacy componentâ€™s model in an eventsourcing migration.

**Multi-temporal Events**  
[multi-temporal-events](https://verraes.net/2022/03/multi-temporal-events/)

> Within a Domain Event, use separate timestamps to distinguish when the event occurred and when it was captured.


# Messaging Patterns

**Ephemeral Events**  
[messaging-patterns-ephemeral-events](https://verraes.net/2019/05/messaging-patterns-ephemeral-events/)

> Mark the events as being Ephemeral Events. The infrastructure knows that only the latest event matters. When a consumer canâ€™t keep up with the event stream coming in, the infrastructure prefers to drop older events and skip to the most recent one.

**Throttling**  
[messaging-patterns-throttling](https://verraes.net/2019/05/messaging-patterns-throttling/)

> Only keep one event per time unit from a high frequency stream.

---

**Change Detection Events**  
[messaging-patterns-change-detection-events](https://verraes.net/2019/05/messaging-patterns-change-detection-events/)

> Listen to a stream of events and produce a new event when a value changes.
